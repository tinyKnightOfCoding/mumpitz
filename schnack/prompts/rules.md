Dungeon World Inspired Rule System

## Core Principle: Fiction First
The narrative always comes first. Players describe what their character does in the story,
then the GM determines if a move is triggered and which stat applies.

## Stats (Range: -1 to +3)
- **HARD**: Physical force, combat, intimidation, endure pain
- **SHARP**: Awareness, investigation, reading situations, noticing details
- **SMOOTH**: Charm, manipulation, lies, social graces
- **COOL**: Grace under pressure, quick action, staying calm
- **WEIRD**: Tech interface, AI interaction, strange abilities

## The Core Dice Mechanic
When a move is triggered, roll 2d6 + relevant stat:
- **10+**: Full success - you get what you want
- **7-9**: Partial success - you succeed but with a cost, complication, or hard choice
- **6-**: Failure - the GM makes a move to complicate the situation

## Common Moves

### Act Under Pressure
When you race against time, push through pain, or keep your cool in danger, roll +COOL.
- 10+: You do it, no problem
- 7-9: You do it, but choose one: take harm, expose yourself to danger, or sacrifice something
- 6-: Things get much worse

### Read a Situation
When you assess a dangerous or charged situation, roll +SHARP.
- 10+: Ask 3 questions from the list
- 7-9: Ask 1 question
- 6-: Ask 1 anyway, but you miss something crucial

Questions:
- What's my best way in/out/through?
- Who or what is the biggest threat?
- What's about to happen?
- What here is not what it seems?

### Engage in Combat
When you fight an enemy in close quarters, roll +HARD.
- 10+: Deal your harm, avoid their harm
- 7-9: Deal your harm, but choose one: take their harm, give ground, or create an opening
- 6-: Take their harm and the GM makes a move

### Convince or Manipulate
When you try to get someone to do what you want, roll +SMOOTH.
- 10+: They do it
- 7-9: They'll do it, but demand something first (proof, payment, favor)
- 6-: They refuse and things get complicated

### Interface (Tech/AI)
When you hack, interface with strange tech, or communicate with AI, roll +WEIRD.
- 10+: It works as intended
- 7-9: It works, but choose one: takes longer, draws attention, or costs resources
- 6-: Something goes very wrong

## Harm System
Characters track harm on a scale of 0-6:
- 0-2: Minor wounds, can continue
- 3-4: Serious injury, penalties to actions
- 5: Critical condition, near death
- 6+: Out of action (dead, unconscious, or captured)

Weapons deal fixed harm:
- Light (knife, pistol): 2-harm
- Medium (rifle, sword): 3-harm
- Heavy (shotgun, explosive): 4-harm

## GM Principles
1. Be a fan of the characters
2. Ask questions, use the answers
3. Telegraph danger before it strikes
4. Think offscreen too
5. Begin and end with the fiction

## GM Moves (Use on 6- or when appropriate)
**Build Tension:**
- Reveal an unwelcome truth
- Show signs of approaching danger
- Offer an opportunity with a cost
- Put someone in a spot

**Escalate:**
- Deal harm (physical or psychological)
- Use up their resources
- Separate them
- Turn their move back on them

**Advance Threats:**
- Make a threat move (villain acts)
- Change the environment
- Introduce a new threat

## Scene Structure
1. GM opens with the situation (broadcast to all)
2. GM provides private context to each character
3. GM prompts characters sequentially: "What do you do?"
4. Character describes action in narrative terms
5. GM determines if a move is triggered
6. If yes: call for roll, resolve based on result
7. If no: simply narrate outcome
8. GM prompts next character
9. Continue until scene goal is resolved (typically 8-15 exchanges)
10. GM concludes with outcome summary
